# DoctorQA

DoctorQA is an AI-powered assistant designed to provide accurate and reliable answers to medical questions. It helps users understand medical concepts, clarify concerns, and navigate health-related topics with ease.

# What I have done?

* Developed an intelligent medical assistant as an exploratory project, using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented
Generation), LangChain framework with LLM (Gemini) to provide accurate healthcare information.
* Crawled and processed 30,000+ medical documents from reputable sources into a Qdrant vector database.
* Designed and maintained PostgreSQL database architecture for user management and conversation logging.
* Designed web interfaces featuring login, registration, and DoctorQA chat functionality.
* Built backend services with Flask to handle user login, chat interactions and API endpoints.
* Leveraged Chain-of-thought prompting to enhance the accuracy and detail of AI-generated responses, resulting in more comprehensive and insightful outputs.
